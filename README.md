## Project Overview

# Usage
 I used the (.) in the connection string. If you have a DB server locally or on a WAN, you need to edit the connection string.
This app is built to use with SQL Server. If you have another DB, you need to change some configurations in the ConfigureServices class in the Infrastructure project.
## To run this app, you should migrate first, then update the DB:
    add-migration "example"
    update-database
